description:
Given a sorted list of distinct integers, write a function that returns whether there are two integers in the list that add up to 0. For example, you would return true if both -14435 and 14435 are in the list, because -14435 + 14435 = 0. Also return true if 0 appears in the list.

Examples
[1, 2, 3] -> false [-5, -3, -1, 2, 4, 6] -> false [] -> false [-1, 1] -> true [-97364, -71561, -69336, 19675, 71561, 97863] -> true [-53974, -39140, -36561, -23935, -15680, 0] -> true
